We are Blair High School’s debate team, one of the largest school organizations and (arguably) the top team in Montgomery County, MD. We are a member of the National Forensic League and practice Public Forum Debate, which means that the topics (“resolutions”) we argue bear direct relevance to real-world problems in global politics, economics, and ethics.

Public Forum Debate is competitive, and historically our school has been a top performer. Ten years ago, the championship debate featured two Blair teams facing off. However, our team spans a range of experience and skill, so don’t let that put you off. Blair Debate is a family, albeit a very large one.

The Blair Debate Team meets every week on Tuesdays in room 251 from 3:20-4:30pm and Thursdays during both lunches. Our meetings consist of news, general feedback, discussion of each month’s resolutions, and informal practice in different aspects of Public Forum Debate. Our sponsor is Mr. Gabaree. The debate season runs from September to January or February depending on how well you do. In addition to participating in the Montgomery County circuit, our debate team also participates in national circuit tournaments.
